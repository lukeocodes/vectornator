## How to Contribute

### Reporting Bugs

1. Check if the bug has already been reported in [Issues](https://github.com/lukeocodes/vectornator/issues)
2. If not, create a new issue with:
   - Clear title and description
   - Steps to reproduce
   - Expected vs actual behavior
   - Environment details (OS, Node version, etc.)

### Suggesting Features

1. Check existing [Issues](https://github.com/lukeocodes/vectornator/issues) for similar requests
2. Create a new issue with:
   - Clear description of the feature
   - Use cases and benefits
   - Potential implementation approach

### Pull Requests

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a feature branch (`git checkout -b feature/amazing-feature`)
3. Make your changes
4. Run tests (`npm test`)
5. Commit with conventional commits (`feat: add amazing feature`)
6. Push to your fork
7. Open a Pull Request

## Adding a New Provider

1. Create a new file in `src/providers/`
2. Extend `BaseVectorStoreProvider`
3. Implement all required methods
4. Register in `src/providers/registry.ts`
5. Add tests
6. Update documentation

Example:

```typescript
import { BaseVectorStoreProvider } from "./base";

export class MyProvider extends BaseVectorStoreProvider {
  name = "myprovider";

  protected async validateConfig(): Promise<void> {
    // Validate configuration
  }

  protected async connect(): Promise<void> {
    // Connect to service
  }

  // ... implement other methods
}
```

## Testing

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run with coverage
npm run test:coverage

# Run in watch mode
npm run test:watch
```

### Writing Tests

- Place tests next to the code they test
- Name test files `*.test.ts`
- Use descriptive test names
- Test edge cases

Example:

```typescript
describe("FileScanner", () => {
  it("should discover markdown files", async () => {
    const scanner = new FileScanner();
    const files = await scanner.scan({ directory: "./test-data" });
    expect(files).toHaveLength(3);
  });
});
```
